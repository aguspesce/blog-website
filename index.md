## A bit about me

I was born and raised in Argentina but now I'm living in Vancouver, Canada.

I'm a Physicist and a PhD in Geophysics.
All those years, I worked in applied geophysics and
studied subduction zones through geodynamical
numerical modeling.

I'm also committed to contribute to open-source software projects to improve
science openness and reproducibility.

When I'm not researching or coding I like to spend time outdoors doing rock
climbing, trekking and or kayaking.
I consider myself an amateur artist as well.
