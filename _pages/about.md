## My story

I'm a Lic. in Physics graduated at the
[Universidad Nacional de Rosario](https://unr.edu.ar/) and a PhD in Geophysics
from the [Universidad Nacional de San Juan](https://www.unsj.edu.ar/).

During my PhD I researched in applied geophysics, processing and analyzing
gravity and magnetic data at the
[Instituto Geofísico Sismológico Volponi](https://igsv.unsj.edu.ar/).

After that, I made a post-doctoral scholarship with
[Dr. Victor Sacek](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Victor-Sacek) from the
[Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas (IAG-USP), Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil](https://www.iag.usp.br/) with the support of
[CONICET](https://www.conicet.gov.ar/).
I started to study subduction zones through geodynamical numerical modeling
using [Mandyoc code](https://ggciag.github.io/mandyoc/).

During my PhD and my postdoc, I had the opportunity to learn and improve my
Python programming skills to process, visualize and analyze data.

Being a longtime GNU/Linux user and Free Software supporter, I'm also committed
to contribute to open-source software projects to improve science openness and
reproducibility.
In this sense, I've made contributions to the libraries of the
[Fatiando a Terra](https://fatiando.org) project (open-source tools for
geophysics) and lately to [Mandyoc](https://github.com/ggciag/mandyoc) (a mantle
dynamics simulator).
I have recently become maintainer of one of the core lessons of
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/).
Moreover, I've started developing [tapIOca](https://github.com/aguspesce/tapioca),
a set of Python tools to load, visualize and analyze the outputs of Mandyoc.

Besides my research, I love teaching and sharing my knowledge.
I'm an assistant professor in Physics courses at the Universidad Nacional de
San Juan, Argentina and  I've taught a few different Python and git tutorials.
I also have the pleasure to be part of the CoCo program, which is an NSF-funded
bilingual project addressed to Latinx and Hispanic students to give them skills
in programming and science communication.
With the intention of improving my teaching skills I became a certified
[Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) instructor.
